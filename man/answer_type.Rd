\usage{
answer_type(answer_code, ..., full_label = FALSE, .FY = 24)
}
\arguments{
\item{answer_code}{\itemize{
\item The "Answer Type" as a string;
\itemize{
\item This includes \code{"unknown"} which will return the unknown answer types: \code{c(8, 9, 99)} \emph{("Client doesnâ€™t know", "Client prefers not to answer", and "Data not collected".)}.
}
\item The HMIS CSV Code as an integer; or
\item \code{"ls"} to get the full list of Answer Types.
}}

\item{...}{These dots are for future extensions and must be empty.}

\item{full_label}{If set to \code{TRUE}, \code{answerType()} will return the full text
of the answer type rather than the shorthand label (i.e., \code{"Client prefers not to answer"} instead of \code{"noAnswer"}). \strong{Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}}

\item{.FY}{The HMIS Data Standards Fiscal Year (entered numerically with two
digits, i.e., \code{22} for FY22). \emph{\strong{Defaults to FY24.}} Can be set backwards
up to FY22 for backwards compatibility with older HMIS Extracts.}
}

}
\description{
If the input is an Answer Type, returns the HMIS CSV Code for that Answer
Type. If the input is an HMIS CSV Code, returns the name of the Answer Type.
