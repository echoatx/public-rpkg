The goal of `ECHO` is to provide reusable functions for common
repetitive tasks when reading, viewing, cleaning, and analyzing HMIS &
CE data, especially from the `.csv` files in the HMIS XML Exports and
the CE BNL.

## Installation

<!-- You can install the development version of ECHO from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->

<!-- # install.packages("devtools") -->

<!-- devtools::install_github("echoatx/echo-rpkg") -->

<!-- ``` -->

You may open the **Packages.RProj** Project in the
*"Research-and-Evaluation-Team/Code/Packages"* folder in ECHO's Dropbox,
and then open the *"easy_installation_script.R"* file and follow the
instructions.

-OR- Use:

``` r
# adjust the path as neccessary to point to the ECHO_0.1.0.tar.gz file from your working directory...
install.packages("../../Code/Packages/ECHO_0.1.0.tar.gz", source=TRUE, repos=NULL)
```
